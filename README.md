# Java-2D-final-assignment
The final assignment for the module Java 2D programming.

This repository contains the project for the final assignment of the module Java 2D programming I followed on the study software engineering (Techinische Informatice) on Avans Hogeschool Breda. This module introduced me to 2D graphics programming in the Java programming language.
